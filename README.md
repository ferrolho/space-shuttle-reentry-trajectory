# Space Shuttle Reentry Trajectory

Computes a 33 minutes 28 seconds reentry trajectory for the Space Shuttle in under ~7 seconds.

The final trajectory is an approximation and only down to the second.
For each 1 second of the trajectory, the result gives the full state of the vehicle and the controls to be commanded to the shuttle.
